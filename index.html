				<h2 class="ABHeader">About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Kyle Barnett. I am 21 years old and a junior at <a href="https://www.unf.edu" target="_blank">UNF</a>. This class will help me learn to write code for websites. I was born in North Carolina and have lived in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida since I was in 5th grade. I live with my parents and my younger brother.</p>
				<p>I achieved my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout" target="_blank">Eagle Scout</a> in 2020 after participating in Boy Scouts since I was in first grade. I particularly enjoyed the leadership skills I learned, the public speaking experience, and the advancement of life skills. I attended many campouts in several states. I have had the opportunity to do a great deal of traveling including trips to Europe and Africa.</p>

				<h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
				<p>I like to participate in the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons" target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons</a> and also play and design video games. I had an internship with <a href="https://skyblivion.com" target="_blank">Skyblivion</a> where I was part of the team remaking the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion. I worked as an interior designer where I created the level design of various interior locations such as houses and caves. I work as a personal assistant helping my client design spreadsheets and data entry. Some of my work requires autonomy in achieving status hearings.</p>
				<p>This is an example of a section of interior that I made for Dorian's House.</p>
