			<h2 class="ABHeader">About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Kyle Barnett. I am 21 years old and a junior at <a href="https://www.unf.edu"
					target="_blank">UNF</a>. This class will help me learn to write code for websites. I was born in
				North Carolina and have lived in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida since I was in 5th grade. I live with my
				parents and my younger brother.</p>
			<p>I achieved my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout" target="_blank">Eagle Scout</a> in 2020
				after participating in Boy Scouts since I was in first grade. I particularly enjoyed the leadership
				skills I learned, the public speaking experience, and the advancement of life skills. I attended many
				campouts in several states. I have had the opportunity to do a great deal of traveling including trips
				to Europe and Africa.</p>

			<h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
			<p>I like to participate in the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons"
					target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons</a> and also play and design video games. I had an internship
				with <a href="https://skyblivion.com" target="_blank">Skyblivion</a> where I was part of the team
				remaking the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion. I worked as an interior designer where I created the level
				design of various interior locations such as houses and caves. I work as a personal assistant helping my
				client design spreadsheets and data entry. Some of my work requires autonomy in achieving status
				hearings.</p>
			<p>This is an example of a section of interior that I made for Dorian's House.</p>

					src="images/1650481774489.jpeg" alt="Dorian's House"></a>
			<p>I enjoy spending time with family at home and traveling with them. I enjoy new life experiences. I like
				to swim and snorkel. I enjoy playing large games with an emphasis on storytelling and decision making. I
				am a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security"
					target="_blank">Cybersecurity</a>, Technology, and TTRPG clubs on campus at <a
					href="https://www.unf.edu" target="_blank">UNF</a>.</p>
